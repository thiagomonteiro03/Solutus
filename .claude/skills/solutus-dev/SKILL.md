# Solutus Development Guide

Always read this skill before making any change to the Solutus project — new features, bug fixes, refactors, or anything that touches source files.

## What the app does

Solutus is a **macOS menu bar app** (not iOS) that:
1. Captures screenshots via `⌘+Shift+S` using `ScreenCaptureKit`
2. Queues them in `AppDelegate.capturedScreenshots`
3. Sends the queue to OpenAI GPT-4o via `⌘+Shift+Enter`
4. Shows the AI response in a floating overlay window that is **invisible to screen recording** (`sharingType = .none`)

## Architecture

```
SolutusApp.swift          → SwiftUI App entry point, sets up AppDelegate
AppDelegate.swift         → Coordinator: owns HotKeyManager, OverlayWindowController, screenshot queue
HotKey/HotKeyManager.swift     → CGEvent tap for keyboard shortcuts
Capture/ScreenCapture.swift    → ScreenCaptureKit wrapper, returns NSImage?
LLM/LLMService.swift           → Singleton, calls OpenAI API, reads OPENAI_API_KEY from env
Overlay/OverlayWindowController.swift  → NSWindow lifecycle (floating, borderless, invisible to recording)
Overlay/OverlayView.swift      → SwiftUI view driven by OverlayContent enum
```

**Key type:** `OverlayContent` enum drives the entire UI:
- `.captured(count: Int)` — shows screenshot count
- `.loading` — shows spinner
- `.solution(String)` — shows AI response
- `.error(String)` — shows error message in red

## Existing test coverage

Before touching any file, understand what's already protected:

| File | Test file | What's covered |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| `AppDelegate` | `AppDelegateTests.swift` | Instantiation, `dismiss()` idempotency, queue starts empty |
| `HotKeyManager` | `HotKeyManagerTests.swift` | Init, start/stop without accessibility permission, multiple cycles |
| `LLMService` | `LLMServiceTests.swift` | Singleton identity, `noAPIKey` guard, `noScreenshots` guard, guard order |
| `LLMError` | `LLMErrorTests.swift` | All error messages in Portuguese, 200-char truncation of apiError body |
| `OverlayView` | `OverlayViewTests.swift` | All OverlayContent states build without crash, frameHeight adapts |
| `OverlayWindowController` | `OverlayWindowControllerTests.swift` | Window creation, reuse, `sharingType == .none`, level/opacity, hide safety |
| `OverlayContent` | `OverlayContentTests.swift` | All enum cases, associated values, pattern matching |
| `ScreenCapture` | `ScreenCaptureTests.swift` | Returns Optional without throwing, parallel calls are safe |
| `TestHelpers` | `TestHelpers.swift` | Shared utilities: solid/empty NSImage, env var sandbox |

## Known gaps (fill as you go)

The existing tests themselves document these TODOs — address them when touching the relevant area:

- `LLMService`: no URL session injection → network path untested. If refactoring to inject `URLSession`, add tests for JSON body structure, base64 conversion, and `apiError` propagation.
- `HotKeyManager`: no tests for specific key dispatch logic. Extract `shouldTrigger(keyCode:flags:) -> Trigger?` as a pure function to make it testable.
- `OverlayView`: SwiftUI tree not deeply inspectable without external libs — frameHeight is tested indirectly only.

## How to approach every change

### Step 1: Identify what's affected
Before writing any code, list which source files will change and which test files cover them (use the table above).

### Step 2: Read the relevant tests
Read the test files for the affected components. Ask: will my change break any existing assertion? If yes, is the break intentional (behavior change) or a regression?

### Step 3: Write or update tests alongside the code
- New public method → new test
- New enum case in `OverlayContent` → new case in `OverlayContentTests`
- New error in `LLMError` → new test in `LLMErrorTests` covering the Portuguese message
- New guard in `LLMService.solve()` → new test covering the guard
- New property on `OverlayWindowController` that affects the window → new test using Mirror if the property is private

### Step 4: Keep tests honest
- Tests use `Mirror` to inspect private state — if you rename a private property, update the mirror lookup in the test.
- Error messages appear directly in the user-facing overlay. If you change an `errorDescription` string, update the corresponding test assertion.
- `OverlayWindowController` has a critical product requirement: `window.sharingType == .none`. Never remove or weaken this — `OverlayWindowControllerTests` will catch it.

### Step 5: Run tests
```bash
# Run all tests
xcodebuild test -scheme Solutus -destination 'platform=macOS'

# Or in Xcode: ⌘+U
```

## Adding a new feature — checklist

- [ ] Which components does this touch? (AppDelegate, HotKeyManager, LLMService, Overlay*)
- [ ] Are existing tests still valid, or does the new behavior change their expectations?
- [ ] Does the new code have any public/observable behavior that deserves a test?
- [ ] If adding a new `OverlayContent` case: add it to `OverlayContentTests` and `OverlayViewTests`
- [ ] If adding a new `LLMError` case: add it to `LLMErrorTests` with the exact Portuguese string
- [ ] Does the change affect `OverlayWindowController` window properties? Verify `sharingType == .none` still holds.
- [ ] If new network behavior in `LLMService`: document it in the test file as a known gap or add a test

## Language and style conventions

- Comments and error messages are in **Portuguese** (Brazilian)
- Use `@MainActor` for any UI-touching code
- `LLMService` is `Sendable` / `nonisolated` — keep network methods `nonisolated`
- `OverlayContent` is the single source of truth for UI state — don't pass raw strings to the view layer
- Tests use Swift Testing framework (`@Suite`, `@Test`, `#expect`) — not XCTest
